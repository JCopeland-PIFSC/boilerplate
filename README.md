<h1>RADFish Boilerplate Application Code</h1>

![test and build workflow](https://github.com/NMFS-RADFish/boilerplate/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg)

The boilerplate is a monorepo containing packages, templates, and examples for building NOAA web applications. The `radfish` and `react-radfish` packages help developers manage offline storage and utilize custom components based on the US Web Design System (USWDS). Additionally, this repository provides examples for building complex forms, tables, and managing application state.

This boilerplate is the parent repository for the [examples and templates](https://nmfs-radfish.github.io/radfish/developer-documentation/examples-and-templates) section of the [official documentation](https://nmfs-radfish.github.io/radfish/).
