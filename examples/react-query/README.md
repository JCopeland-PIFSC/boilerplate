# Mock API Example

[Official Documentation](https://nmfs-radfish.github.io/documentation/)

This example shows you how you could use the [React Query library](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) to manage state in your application.

This example does _not_ include any backend persistence via IndexedDB, as this is out of scope for this example. Instead, this example provides two simplified endpoints to call:

`[GET] /species` returns a list of 4 species
